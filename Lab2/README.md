## Lab 2 - Learning Word Representations

### Steps:
  ```
  1. Copy the datasets in the data folder..
  2. To run the training :

      SkipGram: python skip_gram.py
      Bayesian Skip Gram: python bayesian_skip.py
      Embed-Align: python training.py
        
      Copy the generated model(and files) to the model folder for EmbedAlign

   4.  For evaluating each of the the models you need to run evalution.ipynb.
       Once you have this you will find .out file for running lst_gap.py. 
       Assuming you have a folder named data which contains all the data as mentioned in Assignment.

   5.  For AER evaluation: python evaluation_embedalign.py
