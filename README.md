### Lab 1 - Evaluating Word Representations

**Problem Statement:** The goal of this practical is for you to familiarise yourselves with word representation models and different techniques for evaluating them. The word representation model that you will work with is skip-gram, trained using two kinds of context: dependency-based and word window-based. The dependency based model uses dependency annotated context to learn the word representations, as described in the paper by Omer Levy and Yoav Goldberg, [Dependency-based word embeddings, published at ACL 2014](https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P14/P14-2050/).
